Trying out character level RNN using LSTM

If you're getting cuda error try updating your gpu drivers to latest or rolling back to a previous version.

The model is trained on only "Anna Karenina" so it is just a starter model for more meaningful ouputs please train it more on other datasets.

Open the "Character_Level_RNN_Exercise.ipynb" jupyter notebook and read as you proceed you'll be good to go...
